# Predicting-Stock-Prices-
Overview

Trading in the stock market is one of the most fascinating endeavors I have ever undertaken. The pursuit of making money just by thinking is truly a mind-blowing journey. Stock market is no longer a venture undertaken by people in the wall street market floors wearing suits and ties. Anyone with access to a phone or a computer can trade in the markets now a days. This computerized trading brought more people to the markets and led to an abundance in algorithmic trading. In fact, "70% of all trades happening in the US are being handled by computerized systems."
What traders/investors want in the market is an edge (the higher probably of one thing happening over another). They do so using their own past experiences, reading current market conditions, and doing technical analysis of charts and price patterns. Since machines can process a lot more data and at a faster pace, they can definitely assist traders/investors to make better trading/investing decisions.
In this project, I will try to use an artificial recurrent neural network called Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to predict the closing stock price of a company. My project will be done in Jupyter Notebook using Python as the programming language.
 
Dataset

The data was directly retrieved from yahoo finance's Api so I didn't have to download the data in my system which saves me some space in my local drive. To get the data, I needed to install pandas_datareader. Once I had the libraries and packages, I was able to connect and retrieve the raw data from the Yahoo. 

Methodology

 
Literary Review /Exploratory Analysis/Applying Machine Algorithms

Personally, I have been an active trader in the market for the past 2 years and have read about 10 books on the stock market which equips me with some knowledge in the subject matter. As for the project, I have read quite a bit of literature in the topic of stock price prediction. I have also watched several videos on YouTube that present similar projects on the topic. The references section has the link to those articles and videos.
Iâ€™m doing some exploratory analysis using the pandas library and visualizing them using matplotlib. The machine learning algorithms as mentioned previously is Long Short Term Memory. Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture used in the field of deep learning. LSTM networks are well-suited to classifying, processing and making predictions based on time series data. LSTM models have really fascinating applications such as: speech recognition, robot control, grammar learning, and time series prediction.
