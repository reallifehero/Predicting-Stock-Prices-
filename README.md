# Predicting-Stock-Prices-
Overview

Trading in the stock market is one of the most fascinating endeavors I have ever undertaken. The pursuit of making money just by thinking is truly a mind-blowing journey. Stock market is no longer a venture undertaken by people in the wall street market floors wearing suits and ties. Anyone with access to a phone or a computer can trade in the markets now a days. This computerized trading brought more people to the markets and led to an abundance in algorithmic trading. In fact, 70% of all trades happening in the US are being handled by computerized systems.[1]
What traders/investors want in the market is an edge (the higher probably of one thing happening over another). They do so using their own past experiences, reading current market conditions, and doing technical analysis of charts and price patterns. Since machines can process a lot more data and at a faster pace, they can definitely assist traders/investors to make better trading/investing decisions.
In this project, I will try to use an artificial recurrent neural network called Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to predict the closing stock price of a company. I will also try to use DecisionTreeRegressor and LinearRegression to predict the price of the stock. Once I have done both, I will be able to compare and contrast the results for accuracy from the different models. My project will be done in Jupyter Notebook using Python as the programming language.
 
Dataset

There are two sources that I get my data from. One is from yahoo finance and the other one is quandl library that can installed in Jupyter notebook. Both sources provide me with data directly, so I don’t have to download the data in my system which saves me some space in my local drive. For now, I will hold on to both sources. But as the project progresses, I’ll most likely stick to one of the sources depending the quality of data that I get.
 
Literary Review /Exploratory Analysis/Applying Machine Algorithms

Personally, I have been an active trader in the market for the past one year and have read about 10 books on the stock market. As for the project, I have worked read quite a bit of literature in the topic of stock price prediction. I have also watched several videos on YouTube that present similar projects on the topic. The references section has the link to those articles and videos.
I’m doing some exploratory analysis using the pandas library and visualizing them using matplotlib. The machine learning algorithms as mentioned in the overview section are going to be the following: LSTM, Decision Tree Regressor, and Linear Regression.
